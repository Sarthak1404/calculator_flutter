## Introduction

The Calculator app is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for performing calculations on mobile devices. Leveraging Flutter, an open-source framework, we've created a versatile calculator that meets user needs efficiently.

## Features

1. **Input and Output Display:**
   The app displays the current expression in a clean and organized manner.
   The output area shows the result of the calculation.
   If no expression is entered, it defaults to “0.” 
2. **Responsive Buttons:**
   The calculator buttons are dynamically generated based on the available screen space.
   Buttons include digits (0-9) and common operators (+, -, *, /).
3. **State Management:**
   The state of the calculator is managed using the CalculatorScreen widget.
   It keeps track of the following variables:
   number1: The first operand.
   operators: The operator (e.g., +, -, *, /).
   number2: The second operand.
